### Basics ###

At risk of the [Dunningâ€“Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), I am going to attempt to document my understanding in simple terms and metaphors.  Like this [video](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/embed/p05xtzm1/46150107).

**What is cryptocurrency?**

We don't know all the prime numbers, at best we only know [the last one that people found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_known_prime_number), thanks to the combined efforts of people across the internet.  Think of cryptocurrency mining in the same way; where people with computers who don't know each other work together solving math problems on the internet which might yield the next piece of digital gold, like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH).

**Is it worth anything?**

Gold is just a rock, and like your car, your education, your stocks, or the piece(s) of paper in your wallet -- all these commodities have a *preceived value*.  Simply put, something is worth $5 only when someone else is willing to pay $5 for it.  That same thing is only worth $4 if that is the most someone will buy it for.  Or if it is rare, and multiple people want it, the highest bidder might drive the price to $6.

Everything is subject to inflation, deflation and the laws of supply and demand.  Cryptocurrency is no different.  These different forms of electronic currency have, or don't have, value based on the number of people who agree on its value.   

**What is cryptocurrency?**

The money you give to the bank turns into an agreement -- that the bank will give you that same amount of money back when you decide to withdraw it.  The bank keeps a private record/edger that you can see online.  What does the bank get out of the deal?  They invest your money and keep the interest.

For simplicity's sake, imagine there was a single massive public record/ledger of how much money each person had in their account and every transaction in between -- a complete history of money.  Because it was a public record, you can imagine that people would want to keep an up-to-date personal copy to (1) prove they had money in their account, (2) to prove a transaction happened, and (3) [mutually assured destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction).  

This long ledger is called a [blockchain](https://www.etherchain.org/).  Everytime new cryptocurrency is found, it is added to someone's account in the blockchain.  Everytime cryptocurrency is exchanged for goods, services, or withdrawn -- it is transferred to someone else's account in the blockchain.  New crypto currency can only be mined, and a transfer can only be initiated by the seller, which makes it impossible to fake especially when everyone has a copy of the record/edger.  If someone forgets or loses the password/keys to access their account -- [it is inaccessible forever](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/bitcoin-lost-newport-landfill).  

**How do you convert cryptocurrency into a currency like the USD?**

Groups of people digging for digital gold are called Mining Pools (see below) and they trade their processing power (CPU, GPU, FPGA, and/or ASIC) in exchange for a percentage, the administrator(s) of the mining pool usually take a percentage, aka fee, too.

The pool keeps a tab of how much each person is owed for their efforts and depending on the payout agreement of the pool the person's account is paid in units of the cryptocurrency.  For example, once a someone using the ethermine.org pool  contributes enough processing power to earn 0.05 ETH -- the pool administrators pay the tab by transferring to the miner's account (minus a 1% fee) as an official entry on the [blockchain](https://www.etherchain.org/).  

All cryptocurrency have an exchange rate into Bitcoin (BTC), and BTC is the only cryptocurrency that is converted into USD.  Just like stocks, these conversions happen on exchanges.  It is also at the time of conversions when cryptocurrency is  taxed and tracked.  However, if someone is willing to take payment in cryptocurrency (without a conversion), that makes for harder to trace transactions.

Remote into computer and be able to resume a session
```
$ screen # Start screen for the first time
$ screen -ls
$ screen -x # Attach to an existing screen
```
* Create a new window: __Ctrl-a c__
* Show all windows: __Ctrl-a__ " 

## [Create ETH_WALLET](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Managing-your-accounts) ##
**DO NOT FORGET THE PASSWORD YOU USE** -- password manager?
```
$ geth account new
$ geth account list
```
cp ~/.ethereum/keystore/* > password manager?
 
## [Pools](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer/blob/master/docs/POOL_EXAMPLES_ETH.md) ##
As opposed to solo mining, you can join a pool and trade a ~1% fee for a shared cut of distributed computing with others.  ethpool.org and ethermine.org seem to have the same interface, but different payout structures.  ethpool.org uses credits (https://ethpool.org/credits) which seem to be in favor of larger operations

### Pool: ethermine.org ###
```
$ ethminer -G -R -P stratum1+ssl://ETH_WALLET.WORKERNAME@us2.ethermine.org:5555
```

* status: https://ethermine.org/miners/ETH_WALLET/dashboard
* estimated earnings: https://ethermine.org/miners/ETH_WALLET/payouts
..* ethermine.org pays out once every 24 hours therefore the minimum payout should be close to what your miner produces in 24 hours
* settings: https://ethermine.org/miners/ETH_WALLET/settings
..* register your email, minimum payout amount and validate using your [public IP address](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+my+ip):

## Blockchain Nodes ##
You don't need your own node unless you are starting your own pool or solo mining.  However it is a good thing to do for the community.  Instead of creating a local node you can use a remote one sign up on bittrex and get a eth address from there.

```$ geth --rpc``` downloads a local node of the full ethereum blockchain, use: http://bc.daniel.net.nz/ to determine the necessary hard drive size.

## [Overclocking RX 570 on Ubuntu](http://centosquestions.com/overclocking-radeon-rx-570-ubuntu/) ##

* **VCLK** and **DCLK** are two **UVD** internal clocks.
* **SCLK** is the Engine clock, depends on the current power level.
* **MCLK** is the Memory clock, depends on the current power level.
* **VDDC** (mV) is the GPU core voltage
* **VDDCI** (mV) is the I/O bus voltage (between memory and GPU core) and comes from the PCI-Express slot.
